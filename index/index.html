					<h2>about the project</h2>
					<p>As a conclusion of the Web Design course we had to apply our knowledge from the past six week in our own project. Here you have a "portfolio" of everything that I believe composes my personality. I include programming that after many encounters became what I want to do everyday and writing that is just inevitably a part of me.</p>

					<h2>about me</h2>
					<p>The little things that make this little person are simple. Aspiration for justice, dedication to service, bad jokes with the best of intentions, dreamer, aspiring to change the world a code at a time, trying to sing without much luck, always with family as a top priority, with love for learning, everyday with a broader smile, and trying to help those that cannot say it. That (and probably many things that I forgot to mention) is what makes me Natalia Vallejo Cunillera</p>
