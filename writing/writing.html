					<p>This project was the main assignment of my last year of school. We wrote our own story. While I was wondering what to do I realized I own my personality and my experiences to the people that surround me. For this reason I included all of the letters that have ever been addressed to me, hence the name. <a href="docs/design.pdf"> Read here.</a></p>

					<a href="docs/Un Amor de Hierro Rojo.docx"><h1>Un Amor de Hierro Rojo</h1></a>
					<p>With this story I finally achieved to win the first place of he literary contest. "Un Amor de Hierro Rojo" tells the story of Sof&iacute;a. A teenager that, though her history class, finds a picture of a young Joseph Stalin and starts to fall in love with him. I wrote this story
						as a criticism to teenage love, that does not discriminate and is entirely prematrue. <a href="docs/Un Amor de Hierro Rojo.docx"> Read here.</a>
